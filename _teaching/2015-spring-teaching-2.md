As a Teaching Assistant for Humanoid Robotics and Cognition, I helped students navigate hands-on robotics experiments and understand how sensors, control systems, and AI come together. I offered guidance during labs and office hours, answering questions and supporting students as they explored complex concepts. I also reviewed lab reports and tracked student progress to help the course run smoothly.
