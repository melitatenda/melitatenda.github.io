As a Teaching Assistant for Applied Stochastic Processes, I supported the course by preparing instructional materials and clarifying complex concepts for students. I provided individualized assistance during office hours and recitations, fostering student engagement and understanding of stochastic modeling techniques. I also graded assignments and maintained accurate records of student progress to ensure effective course management.
