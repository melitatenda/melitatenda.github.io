As a Teaching Assistant for Privacy Policy, Law, and Technology, I guided students through complex discussions on data privacy, ethical considerations, and legal frameworks in technology. I supported learning by answering questions, clarifying concepts, and facilitating engagement during seminars and office hours. I also helped review assignments and track student progress to ensure the course ran smoothly.
