This project examined the temporal dynamics of human behavior in advanced manufacturing, focusing on interactions within a Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) system at Carnegie Mellon University. It explored whether human actions follow consistent sequential patterns, how these patterns vary across time scales, and what these variations reveal about cognitive and procedural structure in human-machine collaboration.

Using probabilistic models such as multinomial models, Markov Chains, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), the study analyzed behavioral sequences at multiple temporal resolutions. The results showed that manufacturing behavior is hierarchically organized, with distinct patterns of persistence and transition that change as temporal granularity shifts. Predictive accuracy declined at coarser scales, indicating that fine time scales capture physical persistence, while mid-level scales better reflect decision-making.

The findings introduced the idea of a “deterministic illusion,” where high prediction accuracy at fine scales conceals deeper cognitive processes. This emphasizes the importance of scale-aware modeling when designing intelligent systems that anticipate human actions. By uncovering how behavior simplifies into broader routines at coarser resolutions, the study supports the development of adaptive, human-centered manufacturing systems.
