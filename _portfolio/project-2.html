This research investigates the optimization of product design and supply chain decisions through an integrated approach, challenging traditional sequential methodologies. Using an electrical ground vehicle as a case study, we demonstrate how simultaneous optimization of product attributes and supply chain configurations can lead to improved operational efficiency and profitability. The study employs comparative analysis between conventional sequential design strategies and integrated optimization approaches, evaluating their impact on cost structures, product performance, and supply chain resilience. Our findings reveal significant advantages in adopting integrated optimization strategies, particularly in complex product development scenarios where supply chain considerations directly influence design decisions. The research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in concurrent engineering and supply chain management, offering practical insights for manufacturers seeking to enhance their product development processes.
