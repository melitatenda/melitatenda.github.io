The project focused on developing a functional system to manage employee data, with particular emphasis on attendance tracking. The system featured an **Attendance class** encapsulated within the **Employee class**, enabling efficient recording of employees’ in-time and out-time. It also included methods for calculating total working hours per day and displaying both individual and team attendance records.

In addition to core functionality, the project incorporated data persistence mechanisms to ensure reliable record storage and retrieval. Comprehensive documentation was created through a detailed **README file**, outlining the project’s structure, functionality, and usage to support future maintenance and scalability.
