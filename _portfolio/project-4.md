This project focuses on implementing machine learning techniques for customer segmentation and classification in e-commerce. Using advanced data analytics and ML algorithms, we developed a model to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and interaction patterns. The analysis involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments.

The resulting classification model achieved significant accuracy in predicting customer categories, enabling more targeted marketing approaches. Key outcomes include the identification of high-value customer segments, potential churn risks, and opportunities for personalized marketing campaigns. This segmentation framework provides valuable insights for improving customer relationship management and optimizing marketing resource allocation.
