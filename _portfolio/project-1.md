The project aims to address the severe shortage of sign language interpreters in African classrooms by developing a low-cost robotic system capable of translating between speech and sign language in real time. Designed to cost under $500, the system uses 3D-printed robotic hands to interpret spoken language into sign gestures and translate sign language back into text or speech. This approach offers a sustainable and scalable alternative to human interpreters, ensuring that deaf students in underserved regions can fully participate in classroom learning.

Technically, the system integrates artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. It employs **MediaPipe** for real-time skeletal tracking, **GPT-4o** for multimodal AI processing, and **Jetson Nano Orin** for motor control. The prototype includes a 3D-printed robotic hand capable of performing letters, numbers, and basic signs. The AI pipeline supports both directions of communication—speech-to-sign and sign-to-speech—enabling natural classroom interaction. The modular, open-source design allows for local adaptation and encourages community-driven innovation and maintenance.

By merging affordability, accessibility, and local manufacturability, the project exemplifies how African innovators can use advanced technology to solve region-specific challenges. It not only improves access to education for deaf students but also promotes technological empowerment through open-source collaboration and capacity building. The team’s ongoing efforts focus on completing the dual-hand system and expanding testing with sign language experts to enhance accuracy and cultural relevance.
