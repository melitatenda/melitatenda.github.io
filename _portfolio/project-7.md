This project aims to address the challenges patients face when navigating hospital websites, booking appointments, and accessing services hospital services. These difficulties often stem from complex interfaces which makes it difficult for patients to navigate hospital websites. To tackle this issue,
a web-based intelligent chat-based navigation assistant prototype was developed. This system can provide natural language assistance for navigating services and booking appointments, connect to a mock hospital system API for real-time data on doctor availability, and implement a feedback
mechanism for continuous improvement. Key features include seamless appointment booking without complex medical jargon, direct access to hospital information, efficient navigation to find relevant doctors and services, and real-time notifications for doctors about new appointments. The project,
spanning six sprints, focused on information gathering, component development, system integration, backend development, testing, and deployment. The team created a minimum viable prototype to showcase the system’s capabilities and attract further investment for a comprehensive solution.
