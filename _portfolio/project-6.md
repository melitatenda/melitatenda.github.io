This project focused on developing a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between real and artificially generated (deepfake) voice recordings. Using audio data from Hugging Face and Kaggle, the system applied consistent preprocessing steps—including resampling to 22,050 Hz and extracting Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)—to ensure uniform input representation. 

The final model achieved exceptional performance, reaching a validation accuracy of 99.2% and a test accuracy of 99.5%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications in voice authentication and digital media forensics.
