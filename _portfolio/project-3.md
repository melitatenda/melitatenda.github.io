This research investigates the application of swarm robotics for underwater rescue operations through the development and implementation of a novel Task-Allocation Particle Swarm Optimization (TAPSO) algorithm. The study addresses the challenges of coordinating multiple autonomous underwater robots in complex three-dimensional environments, focusing on efficient target location and obstacle avoidance. Our enhanced PSO algorithm incorporates task allocation mechanisms to optimize the distribution of rescue responsibilities among swarm members.

The methodology involves extensive simulation testing in both 2D and 3D environments, evaluating the algorithm's performance across various scenarios with different levels of complexity. Results demonstrate TAPSO's superior effectiveness compared to traditional PSO approaches, achieving a 100% success rate in simulated rescue missions while maintaining optimal path planning and swarm coordination.

Key contributions include the development of a robust task allocation framework, enhanced obstacle avoidance capabilities, and improved convergence rates in target location. The findings suggest significant potential for practical applications in real-world underwater rescue operations, though further research is needed to address dynamic environmental factors and hardware implementation challenges.
