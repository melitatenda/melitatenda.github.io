### 1. AI for Social Good
I am interested in how artificial intelligence can be applied to improve societal outcomes. This includes exploring projects that make public services more accessible, enhance healthcare delivery, or improve educational tools. I am particularly curious about ways AI can address systemic inefficiencies and contribute to measurable social impact.

### 2. Policy and Governance for Emerging Technologies
I am interested in studying how policy, governance, and organizational frameworks can guide the safe and responsible deployment of advanced technologies. I am especially focused on AI compliance and governance, including how developing countries can help the tech startups deploy AI models ethically and transparently. 

### 3. Robotics and Society
I am interested in the societal implications of robotics and autonomous systems. This includes how robots can interact with people safely, ethically, and effectively, and how their integration into workplaces, homes, and public spaces can be done responsibly. I am particularly curious about human-robot interaction and designing robots that are socially aware as well as technically capable.
